    <p>Registering for an account and logging in currently does not serve a purpose. This website is mainly for showcasing my work and making it easy to access information about me. I really do appreciate your support in wanting to stay up-to-date with everything I have going on.</p>
    <p>That being said, if you create an account, there are no benefits to having one. I will also periodically remove accounts from the system so don't expect for them to be active for long. This is mainly to keep storage loads at a minimum. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
